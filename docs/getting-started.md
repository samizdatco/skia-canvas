## Installation

If you’re running on a supported platform, installation should be as simple as:
```bash
npm install skia-canvas
```

This will download a pre-compiled library from the project’s most recent [release](https://github.com/samizdatco/skia-canvas/releases).


### `pnpm`
If you use the `pnpm` package manager, it will not download `skia-canvas`'s platform-native binary unless you explicitly allow it. You can do this interactively via the ‘approve builds’ command (note that you need to press `<space>` to toggle the selection and then `<enter>` to proceed):

```bash
pnpm install skia-canvas
pnpm approve-builds
```
In non-interactive scenarios (like building via CI), you can approve the build step when you add `skia-canvas` to your project:

```bash
pnpm install skia-canvas --allow-build=skia-canvas
```

Alternatively, you can add a [`pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies`](https://pnpm.io/9.x/package_json#pnpmonlybuiltdependencies) entry to your `package.json` file to mark the build-step as allowed:
```json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "onlyBuiltDependencies": ["skia-canvas"]
  }
}
```



## Platform Support

Skia Canvas runs on Linux, macOS, or Windows as well as serverless platforms like Vercel and AWS Lambda. Precompiled versions of the library’s native code will be automatically downloaded in the appropriate architecture (`arm64` or `x64`) when you install it via npm.

The underlying Rust library uses [N-API][node_napi] v8 which allows it to run on all [currently supported](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) Node.js releases, and it is backward compatible with versions going back to v12.22+, v14.17+, v15.12+, and v16+.

### Linux

The library is compatible with Linux systems using [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) 2.28 or later as well as Alpine Linux and the [musl](https://musl.libc.org) C library it favors. It will make use of the system’s `fontconfig` settings in `/etc/fonts` if they exist but will otherwise fall back to using a [placeholder configuration](https://github.com/samizdatco/skia-canvas/blob/main/lib/fonts/fonts.conf), looking for installed fonts at commonly used Linux paths.

### Docker

If you are setting up a [Dockerfile](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/) that uses [`node`](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) as its basis, the simplest approach is to set your `FROM` image to one of the (Debian-derived) defaults like `node:lts`, `node:22`, `node:24-bookworm`, or simply:
```dockerfile
FROM node
```

If you wish to use Alpine as the underlying distribution, you can start with something along the lines of:

```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
```

### AWS Lambda

Skia Canvas depends on libraries that aren't present in the standard Lambda [runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html). You can add these to your function by uploading a ‘[layer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/chapter-layers.html)’ (a zip file containing the required libraries and `node_modules` directory) and configuring your function to use it.

**Detailed AWS instructions**

#### Adding the Skia Canvas layer to your AWS account

1. Look in the **Assets** section of Skia Canvas’s [current release](https://github.com/samizdatco/skia-canvas/releases/latest) and download the `aws-lambda-x64.zip` or `aws-lambda-arm64.zip` file (depending on your architecture) but don’t decompress it
2. Go to the AWS Lambda [Layers console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home/#/layers) and click the **Create Layer** button, then fill in the fields:
  - **Name**: `skia-canvas` (or whatever you want)
  - **Description**: you might want to note the Skia Canvas version here
  - **Compatible architectures**: select **x86_64** or **arm64** depending on which zip you chose
  - **Compatible runtimes**: select **Node.js 22.x** (and/or 20.x)
3. Click the **Choose file** button and select the zip file you downloaded in Step 1, then click **Create**

Alternatively, you can use the [`aws` command line tool](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) to create the layer. This bash script will fetch the skia-canvas version of your choice and make it available to your Lambda functions.
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
VERSION=3.0.8 # the skia-canvas version to include
PLATFORM=arm64 # arm64 or x64

curl -sLO https://github.com/samizdatco/skia-canvas/releases/download/v${VERSION}/aws-lambda-${PLATFORM}.zip
aws lambda publish-layer-version \
    --layer-name "skia-canvas" \
    --description "Skia Canvas ${VERSION} layer" \
    --zip-file "fileb://aws-lambda-${PLATFORM}.zip" \
    --compatible-runtimes "nodejs20.x" "nodejs22.x" \
    --compatible-architectures "${X/#x/x86_}"
```

#### Using the layer in a Lambda function

You can now use this layer in any function you create in the [Functions console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home/#/functions). After creating a new function, click the **Add a Layer** button and you can select your newly created Skia Canvas layer from the **Custom Layers** layer source.

Note that the layer only includes Skia Canvas and its dependencies—any other npm modules you want to use will need to be bundled into your function. To prevent the `skia-canvas` module from being doubly-included, make sure you add it to the  `devDependencies` section (**not** the regular `dependencies` section) of your package.json file.

### Next.js / Webpack

If you are using a framework like Next.js that bundles your server-side code with Webpack, you'll need to mark `skia-canvas` as an ‘external’, otherwise its platform-native binary file will be excluded from the final build. Try adding these options to your `next.config.ts` file:

```js
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  serverExternalPackages: ['skia-canvas'],
  webpack: (config, options) => {
    if (options.isServer){
      config.externals = [
        ...config.externals,
        {'skia-canvas': 'commonjs skia-canvas'},
      ]
    }
    return config
  }
};
```


## Compiling from Source

If prebuilt binaries aren’t available for your system you’ll need to compile the portions of this library that directly interface with Skia.

Start by installing:

  1. A recent version of `git` (older versions have difficulties with Skia's submodules)
  2. The [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and cargo package manager using [`rustup`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/)
  3. A C compiler toolchain (either LLVM/Clang or MSVC)
  4. Python 3 (used by Skia's [build process](https://skia.org/docs/user/build/))
  5. The [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) build system
  6. On Linux: Fontconfig and OpenSSL

[Detailed instructions](https://github.com/rust-skia/rust-skia#building) for setting up these dependencies on different operating systems can be found in the ‘Building’ section of the Rust Skia documentation. The Dockerfiles in the [containers](https://github.com/samizdatco/skia-canvas/tree/main/containers) directory may also be useful for identifying needed dependencies. Once all the necessary compilers and libraries are present, running `npm run build` will give you a usable library (after a fairly lengthy compilation process).

## Global Settings

> There are a handful of settings that can only be configured at launch and will apply to all the canvases you create in your script. The sections below describe the different [environment variables][node_env] you can set to make global changes. You can either set them as part of your command line invocation, or place them in a `.env` file in your project directory and use Node 20's [`--env-file` argument][node_env_arg] to load them all at once.

### Multithreading

When rendering canvases in the background (e.g., by using the asynchronous [toFile][toFile] or [toBuffer][toBuffer] methods), tasks are spawned in a thread pool managed by the [rayon][rayon] library. By default it will create up to as many threads as your CPU has cores. You can see this default value by inspecting any [Canvas][canvas] object's [`engine.threads`][engine] property. If you wish to override this default, you can set the `SKIA_CANVAS_THREADS` environment variable to your preferred value.

For example, you can limit your asynchronous processing to two simultaneous tasks by running your script with:
```bash
SKIA_CANVAS_THREADS=2 node my-canvas-script.js
```

### Argument Validation

There are a number of situations where the browser API will react to invalid arguments by silently ignoring the method call rather than throwing an error. For example, these lines will simply have no effect:

```js
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 100, "october")
ctx.lineTo(NaN, 0)
```


Skia Canvas does its best to emulate these quirks, but allows you to opt into a stricter mode in which it will throw TypeErrors in these situations (which can be useful for debugging).

Set the `SKIA_CANVAS_STRICT` environment variable to `1` or `true` to enable this mode.
